                                    A couple years ago, my friend first introduced me to the show. I watched one episode... and then I didn't watch another for about two months. Like I said, I honestly think the show is nothing special in content and writing... but he insisted that I give it another try and, keeping an open mind, I did.                                
                                </p>

                                <p class="ab-text">
                                    I slowly began to like it more as the characters grew on me. The characters themselves are interesting and dynamic, with different personalities that range so that everyone can have their favorite.
                                </p>

                                <p class="ab-text">
                                    I mean if you feel like your the reserved type, you can relate to Fluttershy. If you're an incredibly hard worker, you can sympathize with Applejack. If your egotistical, Rainbow Dash may be for you. They each have a unique personality and it is entertaining in that mash up. 
                                </p>

                                <p class="ab-text">
                                    But what really keeps me around is the community. All the art, games, flashes (we can ignore the fanfics), and music just add so much to the show.
                                </p>

                                    And to answer your final question. Yes there are other shows out there like it... I don't only watch My Little Pony. I just happen to like this more than most other shows out.

                                    I started with tinkering when I was a young, simply because I had nothing to do with my spare time. We didn't have internet before and the only thing that I had for entertainment was an old laptop.
                                </p>
                                
                                <p class="ab-text">
                                    Apart from going outside to play, I spent most of my time with that very own laptop. I didn't want to go outside and spend money on computer shops and I stayed loyal to that one single decrepit piece of legacy hardware.
                                </p>

                                    I constantly suffered from low FPS when in comes to playing video games such as MW2 & MW. Even older games suffered. It was that bad. So I had to spend most of my time optimizing and squeezing every single piece of frames that I can get from my hardware.
                                </p>

                                <p class="ab-text">
                                    As you may know, there's only so much you can do from squeezing out performance out of an OS. So I started to find a job, earned enough cash, and built my own PC.
                                </p>

                                <p class="ab-text">
                                    Ever since then, PC building has become a fun hobby albeit quite expensive at certain times for me.

                                    I love Pinkie Pie. She's been my favorite pony for years now and that's not likely to change. She's adorable, happy-go-lucky, weird in all the right ways, quite funny when she wants to be, and is always looking for ways to put smiles on ponies' faces.
                                </p>

                                    She can definitely be a bit much at times, what with her penchant for jokes and gags, somewhat clingy nature and occasional obliviousness to other's feelings, but nopony is perfect. I know she means well at the end of the day.
